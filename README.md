# YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis Project
This file will serve as the main entry point for your project, providing an overview, motivation, objectives, prerequisites, and steps to use the project
## Motivation:
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of YouTube comments on a specific video. Understanding audience sentiment can provide valuable insights for content creators, marketers, and researchers. By analyzing comments, we can gain a deeper understanding of how viewers perceive the content and identify areas for improvement.

## Objectives:
- Analyze sentiment in YouTube comments to understand audience perception.
- Provide feedback to content creators for content optimization.
- Gain practical experience in sentiment analysis techniques and data retrieval.

## Prerequisites:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Necessary Python libraries: `requests`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`
- YouTube Data API key (instructions provided in the project)

## Takeaways:
- Improved understanding of sentiment analysis techniques.
- Practical experience in data retrieval and manipulation.
- Insights into audience engagement and feedback.

## After Making This Project, You Will Be Able To:
- Perform sentiment analysis on text data.
- Retrieve data from the YouTube Data API.
- Visualize sentiment analysis results using Python libraries.

## Steps of Model Development:
1. Data collection: Retrieve YouTube comments using the YouTube Data API.
2. Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
3. Sentiment analysis: Analyze the sentiment of each comment using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer.
4. Visualization: Visualize the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral comments using matplotlib.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Obtain a YouTube Data API key and replace the placeholder in the code.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to retrieve and analyze YouTube comments.
